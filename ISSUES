(listed roughly in order of priority)

==== BUGS ====
>> Spaces don't work in tags
   Check escaping when we run the background shell task.

>> Import error - "glob" module not found.
   No idea why this could be.

==== IMPROVEMENTS ====

>> A proper tags picker in the "feeds" tab.
>> allow an "all items" pseudo-tag
>> Multi-level picker (drill-down via tag). This would probably be in a seperate tab from the "all items" tab, for simplicity.
>> Orientation. It's wiggidy-whack. But this might not be easy to fix, as the API is quite limited
